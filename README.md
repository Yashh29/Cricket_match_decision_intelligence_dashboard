🏏 Cricket Match Decision Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Cricket Match Decision Intelligence Dashboard built using Power BI, focused on T20 International cricket.
Instead of traditional scorecard-style analysis, the dashboard converts ball-by-ball data into context-aware insights and tactical recommendations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how raw sports data can be transformed into actionable match intelligence, similar to how professional analysts and broadcasters evaluate games.

🎯 Key Objectives

Analyze match performance beyond basic runs and wickets

Understand pressure, risk, and momentum shifts across match phases

Evaluate player performance under pressure

Identify team scoring vs risk patterns

Provide data-driven tactical recommendations based on match situations

🧠 What Makes This Project Different

Most cricket dashboards stop at averages and totals.
This project focuses on decision-making, answering questions like:

When did the match momentum shift?

Which phase hurt the team the most?

Which players handled pressure effectively?

Should the team accelerate or stabilize at a given moment?
